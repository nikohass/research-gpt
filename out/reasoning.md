The task is to identify stocks with high short interest that could lead to a short squeeze in the event of positive catalysts. It involves performing deep research on atleast 5 stocks and providing detailed information including the stock's price, market cap, float, short interest, short ratio, and other key metrics. In addition, a summary of the company's business model, products, and services is required. To approach this task, the following are the steps I plan to undertake:

* Step 1: Conduct a search for the list of stocks with high short interest using a reliable financial/investment analysis website.
* Step 2: From the list obtained, select top five stocks based on short interest for further analysis.
* Step 3: For each of the top five stocks, conduct a search to obtain detailed metrics including stock price, market cap, float, short interest, short ratio, etc from a reputable financial data provider website.
* Step 4: Conduct an individual search to gather information about each company's business model, products, and services from their respective official websites or from a reliable business database website.
* Step 5: Compile all the information acquired and perform due diligence. Any stock undeserving mention will be removed after detailed examination.
